# **MegamVertice** uses `nsq.io` as the messaging layer using a push architecture up until 1.5.x series.

This guide provides information for the development team to learn and start bug fixing.

## Topics we use

The section `NSQ` in the [gateway.conf](https://github.com/megamsys/verticegateway/blob/1.5.2/conf/gateway.conf) has information about the same.

Broadly `vms`, `containers`, `marketplaces`.

In 2.0 we are moving to a `watch-pull periodically architecture` which eliminates the issues we have today on the `push tasks`.
